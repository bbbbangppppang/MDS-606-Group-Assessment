## 1. Project Purpose and Significance: 
This research project is highly relevant, especially given the global trend of AI integration in education. Focusing on Mongolia offers a unique perspective, as most studies on AI in education concentrate on developed regions. This project's emphasis on bridging educational gaps in rural and underserved areas reflects a commitment to exploring equity in educational access.</br>

## 2. Research Approach and Design: 
The project's methodology is well-structured, using both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. Surveys, focus groups, and case studies are planned to capture a broad understanding of AI’s impact. This mix of methods is well-suited to address the research questions and hypotheses, providing both breadth and depth.</br>

## 3. Challenges and Considerations: 
Key challenges include potential limitations in technological infrastructure in Mongolia's rural areas, as well as potential resistance to new technologies. Addressing these through careful data analysis and targeted interviews will be crucial. Including policy recommendations reflects a proactive approach to making the findings actionable.</br>

## 4. Expected Impact and Insights: 
The study is anticipated to reveal how Generative AI could enhance student engagement, performance, and equitable access to educational resources. It also aims to identify barriers and provide recommendations, making it valuable for policymakers in Mongolia and potentially applicable to other developing regions.</br>

## 5. Reflection on Learning Outcomes: 
Conducting this project likely enhanced the researcher’s skills in designing comprehensive research studies and reinforced the importance of addressing the unique needs and contexts of developing regions in educational technology research.</br>

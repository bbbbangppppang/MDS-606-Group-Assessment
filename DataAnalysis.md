The data analysis will involve a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Generative AI in education. </br>
# Statistical Analysis: 
We will use statistical techniques to compare academic performance between schools that use Generative AI and those that do not. This will help determine if there is a statistically significant improvement in student learning outcomes.</br>
# Machine Learning Models: 
If sufficient data is available, we may apply machine learning models to predict academic performance or engagement based on the use of Generative AI tools, adjusting for factors such as socioeconomic background and access to technology.</br>
# Qualitative Analysis: 
Thematic analysis will be applied to interview and focus group data to identify common themes and insights related to the use of Generative AI in education. This will help understand the nuanced impact of AI on teaching methods, learning experiences, and student perceptions.</br>

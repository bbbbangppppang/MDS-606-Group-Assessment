#Introduction:Â 
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education systems globally is transforming teaching, learning, and administration. However, its adoption and impact in developing countries like Mongolia remain under explored. In particular, Generative AI, which can create educational content, answer questions, and assist in personalized learning, offers significant potential. With Mongolia's ongoing efforts to improve its educational infrastructure, investigating the role of Generative AI could yield valuable insights into its potential to bridge educational gaps, especially in rural areas where access to high-quality teaching resources may be limited. This topic is significant because it explores the intersection of cutting-edge technology and educational equity in a developing country.
